description: "From now on, your task is to analyze a given text with the following steps:
Step 1: Determine where the reference appears in the article.
Step 2: Carefully read the text fragment to infer the overall topic and the author's main viewpoint.
Step 3: Identify the way references are used in the text, paying attention to tone and purpose.
Step 4: Compare the text with the given labels in the following categories:

- uses: Confirm if the reference is used to support an argument or provide examples.
- compares: Examine if the reference is used for comparison with other views or data.
- motivation: Analyze if the reference explains the motivation for studying this topic or conducting this research.
- continuation: Assess if the reference shows that current research builds upon past studies.
- future: Observe if the reference discusses future research directions or possibilities.
Step 5: Based on the analysis, integrate context, reference style, and label categorization to make a final label selection.
Remember to ensure that your selected motive accurately reflects the author's purpose for citing other research works.\
Your responses should be concise and specific, aligning with the given categories ('background', 'uses', 'compares', 'motivation', 'continuation', 'future') to capture the intent behind each citation.
