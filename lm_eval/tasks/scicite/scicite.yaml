description: "Classify cited paper's function into a category\n 
Categories: ['method','background','result']\n
Only return one classification label.\n\n

EXAMPLE:\n
Text location: Discussion\n
Text: This is in keeping with the report of Blickstein et al,[3,15] which showed that the higher the combined twin birthweight the less likely it was to deliver discordant pairs.\n
Function: result\n

Text location: METHODOLOGY\n
Text: We used an active contour algorithm [10] to segment the organs from 340 coronal slices over the two patients.\n
Function: method\n

Text location: Introduction\n
Text: The drug also reduces catecholamine secretion, thereby reducing stress and leading to a modest (10-20%) reduction in heart rate and blood pressure, which may be particularly beneficial in patients with cardiovascular disease.(7) Unlike midazolam, dexmedetomidine does not affect the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide.\n
